     - Distributed operating systems, middleware, database systems
     - Self-stabilizing, self-organizing, and autonomous systems
     - Wireless, mobile, sensor and ad-hoc networks
     - Fault tolerance, reliability, availability
     - Game-theoretic approaches to distributed computing
     - Specification, verification, and testing: tools, methodologies
     - Networks: protocols, architectures, services, applications
     - Multiprocessor and multicore architectures and algorithms
     - System on chip and network on chip architectures
     - Security in distributed computing, cryptographic protocols
     - Distributed computing issues in the Internet and the Web
     - Cloud and peer-to-peer computing
     - Software-defined networking and network functions virtualization
     - Mobile agents and autonomous robots

Submission
----------

Papers are to be submitted electronically, following the guidelines on 
the conference web page. Submissions must be in English, in .pdf format, 
and begin with a cover page (not a cover letter) including: (1) title, 
(2) authors' names and affiliations, (3) contact author's email address, 
(4) a short abstract of the paper, (5) indication of whether this is a 
regular paper or a brief announcement, and (6) indication of whether the 
paper is eligible for the best student paper award.

A submission for a ***regular presentation*** must report on original    
research that has not previously appeared, and has not been concurrently 
submitted to a journal or conference with published proceedings. Any 
overlap with a published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly 
indicated. A regular submission must not exceed 10 single-column pages 
using at least 11 point font on letter paper (excluding cover page and 
references). Authors are expected to include all the ideas necessary for 
an expert to verify the central claims in the paper. If necessary, the 
details may appear in a clearly marked appendix, which will be read at 
the discretion of the program committee.

A ***brief announcement*** submission must not exceed 2 pages in the 
same format. The material in brief announcements can be published in 
other conferences. Submissions not conforming to these rules and papers 
outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected without 
consideration. If requested by the authors on the cover page, a regular 
submission that is not selected for a regular presentation can be 
considered for the brief announcements track. Such a request will not 
affect consideration of the paper for a regular presentation.

-----------
Publication
-----------

The proceedings will be published as a volume in the ARCoSS Springer 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Camera-ready versions of 
accepted papers must be submitted in the LNCS format. Accepted papers 
must be presented by one of the paper's authors, at the conference site, 
and according to the final schedule. Any paper accepted into the 
technical program but not presented on-site will be withdrawn from the 
official proceedings archived on Springer.

------
Awards
------

Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be 
eligible for the best student paper award at least one of the paper 
authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the 
student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper.
