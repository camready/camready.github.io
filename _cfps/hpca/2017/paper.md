HPCA-23 Call for Papers
23rd IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture
Austin, Texas, USA, February 4 - 8, 2017
http://www.hpcaconf.org/hpca23
(collocated with PPoPP-2017 and CGO-2017)

Important dates:
- Abstract submission: July 25, 2016, 11:59 PM CDT (firm deadline)
- Paper submission: August 1, 2016, 11:59 PM CDT (firm deadline)
- Notification of paper outcome: October 12, 2016

The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture
provides
a high-quality forum for scientists and engineers to present their latest
research findings in this rapidly-changing field. Authors are invited to
submit papers on all aspects of high-performance computer architecture.
Topics
of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Processor, cache, and memory architectures
- Parallel computer architectures
- Multicore and multiprocessor architectures
- Impact of technology on architecture
- Power-efficient architectures and techniques
- Dependable/secure architectures
- High-performance I/O systems
- Embedded, reconfigurable, and heterogeneous architectures
- Interconnect and network interface architectures
- Architectures for cloud-based HPC and data centers
- Innovative hardware/software trade-offs
- Impact of compilers and system software on architecture
- Performance modeling and evaluation
- Architectures for emerging technology and applications

Authors should submit an abstract by July 25, 2016 11:59 PM CDT. They should
submit the full version of the paper August 1, 2016, 11:59 PM CDT.  No
extensions will be granted. The full version should be a PDF file following
the submission guidelines that will be made available at the submission
website.  Papers should be submitted for blind review. We anticipate making
a
Best Paper award; all papers will be evaluated based on their novelty,
fundamental insights, experimental evaluation, and potential for long-term
impact.  New-idea papers as well as papers that significantly advance
established areas are strongly encouraged. Submission issues should be
directed to the program chair at djimenez at cse.tamu.edu .  HPCA-23 will host
an
Industrial Paper Session presenting novel insights from industry. Submission
details will be announced soon.
