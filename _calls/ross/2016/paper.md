International Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers
                          ***  ROSS 2016  ***

                    In cooperation with ACM SIGHPC
                    --------------------------------
Held in conjunction with HPDC 2016, Kyoto, Japan, June 1, 2016

=======================================================================

The complexity of node architectures in supercomputers increases as we
cross petaflop milestones on the way towards Exascale. Increasing
levels of parallelism in multi- and many-core chips and emerging
heterogeneity of computational resources coupled with energy and memory
constraints force a reevaluation of our approaches towards operating
systems and runtime environments.

The ROSS workshop, to be held as a full-day meeting at the HPDC 2016
conference in Kyoto, Japan focuses on principles and techniques
to design, implement, optimize, or operate runtime and operating systems
for supercomputers and massively parallel machines.

TOPICS OF INTEREST:
-------------------

- OS and runtime system scalability on many-node and multi/many-core
  systems
- specialized OSs for Supercomputing
- management of heterogeneous compute resources
- distributed/hybrid/partitioned OSs and runtime systems for
  Supercomputing
- management of reconfigurable compute resources
- fault tolerance
- system noise analysis and prevention
- interaction between middleware, runtime system, and the OS
- modeling and performance analysis of runtime systems
- OS and runtime considerations for large-volume, high-performance I/O
- parallel job startup
- memory management and emerging memory technologies
- the role of OS and runtime system in minimizing power usage
- real-time considerations for Supercomputing
