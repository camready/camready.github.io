IEEE Cluster 2016 is the 18th edition of the IEEE Cluster conference 
series, and will be held Sep 12, 2016 - Sep 16, 2016 in Taipei, Taiwan.

Clusters are the primary architecture for building today's rapidly 
evolving cloud and HPC infrastructures, and are used to solve some of 
the most complex problems. The challenge to make them scalable, 
efficient, and more functional requires a community effort in the 
areas of cluster system design, management and monitoring, at the 
hardware, system, middleware and application levels. 

Following the successes of previous IEEE Cluster conferences, for 2016 
we again solicit high-quality original work that advances the 
state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields. All papers 
will be rigorously peer-reviewed for their originality, technical 
depth and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, 
and quality of presentation. Research papers must clearly demonstrate 
novel research contributions while papers reporting experiences must 
clearly describe lessons learned and impact, along with the utility of 
the approach compared to previous ones. 

Authors must indicate the primary area of preference out of the four 
areas below. They may optionally rank the other areas. The paper may 
be accepted as a full paper, or the committee might decide to accept 
it as a short paper with 4 pages in the proceedings. 

Area 1: Application, Algorithms, and Libraries 
* HPC applications on clusters 
* Performance modeling and measurement 
* Novel algorithms on clusters 
* Hybrid programming techniques (e.g., MPI+OpenMP) 
* Cluster benchmarks 
* Application-level libraries on clusters 
* Effective use of clusters in novel applications 
* Performance evaluation tools 

Area 2: Architecture, Network/Communications, and Management 
* Energy-efficient cluster architectures 
* Node and system architecture 
* Packaging, power and cooling 
* GPU/ManyCore and heterogeneous clusters 
* Interconnect/memory architectures 
* Single system image clusters 
* Administration and maintenance tools 

Area 3: Programming and System Software 
* Cluster system software/operating systems 
* Cloud-enabling cluster technologies and virtualization 
* Energy-efficient middleware 
* Cluster system-level protocols and APIs 
* Cluster security 
* Resource and job management 
* Programming and software development environments on clusters 
* Fault tolerance and high-availability 

Area 4: Data, Storage, and Visualization 
* Cluster architectures for big data storage and processing 
* Middleware for big data management 
* Cluster-based cloud architectures for big data 
* File systems and I/O libraries 
* Support and integration of non-volatile memory 
* Visualization clusters and tiled displays 
* Big data visualization tools 
* Programming models for big data processing 
* Big data application studies on cluster architectures
