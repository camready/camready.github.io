CALL FOR PAPERS: “Data through the Computational Lens”

The 16th International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2016) will take place in San Diego, California, USA, on June 6-8, 2016. With an average attendance of 350 participants, an excellent lineup of keynote speakers and over 20 thematic workshops, ICCS is the prime annual event in Computational Science, bringing together researchers and scientists from academics and industry.

The theme for ICCS 2016 refers to the crucial role of Computational Science in tackling the myriad problems and applications stemming from a society that produces and analyzes data at an ever-increasing rate. Located on the Pacific coast of California, San Diego is known for its beautiful beaches and parks, warm climate and world-class attractions.

We invite original contributions on all topics related to Computational Science, including, but not limited to:
 Scientific Computing
 Problem Solving Environments
 Advanced Numerical Algorithms
 Complex Systems: Modeling and Simulation
 Hybrid Computational Methods
 Web- and Grid-based Simulation and Computing
 Parallel and Distributed Computing
 Advanced Computing Architectures and New Programming Models
 Large Scale Scientific Instruments
 Visualization and Virtual Reality as Applied to Computational Science
 Applications of Computation as a Scientific Paradigm
 New Algorithmic Approaches to Computational Kernels and Applications
 Computational Humanities
 Education in Computational Science
 Computational Sociology
 Medical and Biomedical Computational Science
