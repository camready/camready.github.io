                     **** CALL FOR PAPERS ****

                 The 25th International ACM Symposium on
          High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing
                             (HPDC-2016)

               Kyoto, Japan - May 31 through June 4, 2016

                        http://www.hpdc.org/2016
                        Sponsored by ACM SIGARCH
                     In-Cooperation with ACM SIGHPC

The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed
Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for presenting the latest
research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and the use of parallel
and distributed systems for high-end computing.

The 25th HPDC will take place in historic Kyoto, Japan from May 31st to
June 4th, 2016. (Workshops on May 31 and June 1, main conference on June 2-4.)
Kyoto was designated a World Heritage Site in 1994 for its many historic
monuments built during the more than 1000 years in which it served as the
Japanese capital and cultural center.


**** IMPORTANT DATES ****
Abstracts (required) due:   January 11, 2016
Full Papers due:            January 18, 2016 (no extensions)
Author rebuttal period:     March 2-4,  2016
Author notifications:       March 12,   2016



**** SCOPE AND TOPICS ****
Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing
topics including but not limited to: clouds, clusters, grids, big data,
massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Submissions that focus
on the operating systems, runtime environments, architectures, and networks of
high end computing systems are particularly encouraged. Experience reports
of operational deployments that provide significantly novel insights for
future research on HPDC applications and systems will also receive special
consideration. All papers will be evaluated for their originality, technical
depth and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, and
quality of presentation. Research papers must clearly demonstrate research
contributions and novelty, while experience reports must clearly describe
lessons learned and demonstrate impact.

In the context of high-performance parallel and distributed computing, the
topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Operating systems, networks, and architectures
- High performance runtime environments
- Massively multicore systems
- Resource virtualization
- Programming languages
- File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
- Resource management and scheduling, including energy-aware techniques
- Performance modeling and analysis
- Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability
- Applications and services that depend upon high-end computing


**** PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ****
Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most 12 pages in PDF
format, including figures and references. Papers should be formatted in the ACM
Proceedings Style and submitted via the conference web site. No changes to the
margins, spacing, or font sizes as specified by the style file are allowed.
Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and will be
incorporated into the ACM Digital Library. A limited number of papers will be
accepted as posters.

Papers must be self-contained and provide the technical substance required for
the program committee to evaluate their contributions. Submitted papers must be
original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for
another conference or a journal. See the ACM Prior Publication Policy for more
details. Papers can be submitted at https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/hpdc/.
